# This is no longer needed to install ND Framework
To facilitate testing of v2 of the ND Framework, three files contained in the bridge and MySQL modules had to be modified so that `ox_inventory` could speak to the correct table structure in `ND_Core`. These files were modified in a pull request to `ox_inventory`. Now that this has been merged, the files included in this repository are no longer required. I am keeping them here as an archive for now.

## Directions

âœ… Make a backup of your ðŸ“‚**ox_inventory** â†’ ðŸ“‚**modules** folder

âœ… Unzip these files into your ðŸ“‚**ox_inventory** folder. This will overwrite three files:

    ðŸ“‚ox_inventory
      ðŸ“‚modules
        ðŸ“‚bridge
          ðŸ“‚nd
            ðŸ“„client.lua
            ðŸ“„server.lua
          ðŸ“‚mysql
            ðŸ“„server.lua

âœ… Restart your server.
